The current configuration includes 3 beds and 3 baths over 2,528 SF, while the original public records indicate it had 4 baths. Due to the absence of permit data, the extent of renovations or additions remains unclear, and thus the value added is indeterminate. The property is currently listed for approximately $2.8 million, suggesting a significant target spread, though specific hold durations or ROI calculations cannot be established."
