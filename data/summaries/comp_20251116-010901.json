  "summary_markdown": "### DEAL SNAPSHOT\n- **Address:** 1393 Casiano Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90049\n- **Current Configuration:** 3 beds, 3.0 baths, 2,528 SF\n- **Original Configuration:** 3 beds, 4.0 baths, year built 1959\n- **SF Changes:** Configuration reflects a reduction in bathrooms but no explicit SF change data available. \n- **Purchase Price:** $1,200 (November 27, 2019)\n- **Current Listing Price:** $15,403 (Listed on September 22, 2021)\n- **Hold Period:** 665 days\n- **Gross Spread:** $14,203\n- **Gross ROI:** 1183.58%\n\n### SCOPE OF WORK (PERMITS)\n- **Permits:** No LADBS permit data is available due to a driver failure. Thus, I can't provide insights into any core building or addition permits, nor can I assess any major work completed in the last 5\u201310 years. There are no open/active/not-final permits to report.\n\n### TEAM (COMPETITOR NETWORK)\n- **General Contractor:** Not available\n- **Architect:** Not available\n- **Engineer:** Not available\n- **Notes:** Due to the absence of permit data, no contractor or firm patterns can be identified.\n\n### PERMIT TIMING (DURATIONS)\n- **Main Building/Addition Permit:** Not available due to lack of permits/data. No durations can be provided since there are no underlying dates.\n\n### VALUE-ADD SUMMARY\nThe property at 1393 Casiano Rd was acquired for $1,200 and subsequently listed for $15,403 after 665 days of holding. The core development features a change in bathroom configuration, transitioning from 4 to 3 baths. Unfortunately, lacking sufficient detail on permits or structural changes limits the insight into the specifics of the improvements made. The gross ROI indicates a highly speculative upward trend in market value, showcasing a significant growth target."
