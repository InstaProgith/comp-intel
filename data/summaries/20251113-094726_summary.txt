The property at 13157 Otsego in Sherman Oaks is currently configured with 5 bedrooms, 5.5 bathrooms, and a living area of 3,864 square feet. Originally, it had 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, with a living area of just 1,662 square feet. The developer purchased the property for $1,460,000 on May 30, 2024, and is looking to list it for $3,795,000 on November 4, 2025. This represents a gross spread of $2,335,000 after a hold period of 523 days, yielding a gross ROI of approximately 1.60. I don't see any LADBS permit data available for this property.
