This lack of data may indicate limited recent redevelopment or building activity, requiring further investigation for thorough due diligence.\n\n### TEAM (COMPETITOR NETWORK)\n- **General Contractor:** Not available\n- **Architect:** Not available\n- **Structural Engineer:** Not available\n- **Notes:** There are no available project contacts or contractors listed in the data.\n\n### PERMIT TIMING (DURATIONS)\n- **Main Building/Addition Permit:** Not available due to zero permits found. Therefore, no duration calculations can be provided.\n\n### VALUE-ADD SUMMARY\nThe property at 7841 Stewart Ave was acquired and has been modified to feature an additional half bath and a significant increase in living space, translating into a larger 2,890 SF footprint from the original 1,965 SF configuration. However, the absence of purchase data limits the analysis of added value and investment metrics. The current listing price of $3,849,000 suggests a strategic exit positioning, but further financial analysis is hampered by missing historical purchase information."
