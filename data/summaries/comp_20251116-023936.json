  "summary_markdown": "## DEAL SNAPSHOT\n- **Address:** 7841 Stewart Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90045\n- **Current Configuration:** 4 beds, 4.5 baths, 2,890 SF\n- **Original Configuration (Public Records):** 4 beds, 3 baths, 1,965 SF\n- **SF Added or Changed:** +925 SF\n- **Purchase Price + Date:** Not available\n- **Current Listing Price + Listing Date:** $3,849,000 (Listed on Nov 13, 2025)\n- **Hold Period in Days:** Not available\n- **Gross Spread:** Not available\n- **Gross ROI:** Not available\n\n## SCOPE OF WORK (PERMITS)\nThe property has undergone significant renovations in the past few years, encapsulated by a major remodel that included a garage addition at the front and side of the residence, culminating in the addition of approximately 925 SF to the living space. The primary permit issued since 2020 for this major remodeling effort was approved on December 13, 2022.\n\nAdditional permits include several minor repairs and remodel work, with the latest ones under refund status indicating changes or cancellations made by the Owner-Builder. No open or active permits remain, with the last major remodeling permit currently pending final inspections.\n\n## TEAM (COMPETITOR NETWORK)\n- **GC:** Owner-Builder \n- **Architect:** Not specified\n- **Engineer:** Carrillo, Jesus Eduardo; Lic. No.: C77737\n- **Notes:** The Owner-Builder is consistently used across multiple permits, indicating a repeat player strategy. Engineer Carrillo is also a repeat, involved multiple times for different permits.\n\n## PERMIT TIMING (DURATIONS)\nFor the main building/addition permit (Permit Number: 22014-10000-05520):\n- **Submitted \u2192 Plan Check Approved:** 35 days (From 11/8/2022 to 12/13/2022)\n- **Plan Check Approved \u2192 Issued:** 0 days (Approved and issued on the same day, 12/13/2022)\n- **Issued \u2192 Finaled:** Not finaled.\n\n## VALUE-ADD SUMMARY\nThe property was acquired as a 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom home, originally at 1,965 SF. A substantial remodeling and addition effort has expanded the structure to 2,890 SF, increasing livability and potentially enhancing market value significantly. The addition of 925 SF and the aesthetic upgrades likely justify a higher valuation, positioning the property at a current listing price of $3,849,000. The exact value added, hold period, and ultimate financial spread remain unclear due to missing purchase and sale details."
